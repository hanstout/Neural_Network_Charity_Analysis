# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview:  
With knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, features in the provided dataset are used to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
## Review:  
* Classification identification columns EIN and NAME were dropped  
* A variable considered a target was the IS_SUCCESSFUL column
* Variables considered features in the model are: APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT
## Summary:  
To summarize, deep neural network machine learning model produced a binary classifier in predicting whether loaning to a given applicant will produce successful results. Accuracy never reached 75%, but stayed at 71%. I recommended to try another supervised learning classification model like ensemble-based random forest classifier.
